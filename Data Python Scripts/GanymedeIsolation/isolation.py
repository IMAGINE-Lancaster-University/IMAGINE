# Given ASCII .txt input for December and May, the script will:
# Reformat the time so that it is seconds since the beginning of the timeseries.
# Average the magnetic field for timeseries point for each month.
# Calculate the average deviation between the two plots (excluding Ganymede encounter).
# Adjust the May plot using these average values so that it is the same magnitude as the December plot.
# Subtract the May data points from the December data points.
